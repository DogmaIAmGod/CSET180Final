            <p>You were enough of an idiot to actually buy stuff from a
            website called Scammazon for crying out loud.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sentence">
            <p> If you're dumb enough to do that, than you absolutely
            deserve to have your information stolen.</p>

            <p>Here at Scammazon, we have a policy that all new customers
            get doxxed after their first purchase.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sentence">
            <p>We do however, give customers the option to either doxx
            themselves, or someone else they know.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sentence">
            <p>If you refuse to give away your's or anyone else's information
            we will share the info all all other users.</p>

            <h1>Impotant Notice:</h1>
        <p>I don't think I need to really say this, but this is obviously
        not real. It was just a stupid joke I thought would be funny  to
        include on the thank you page. All the data shown here is fake,
        and nobody's actual information was stolen or sold.</p>
